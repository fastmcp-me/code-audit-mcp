# MCP Code Audit Server - Project Completion

## Project Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) Code Audit Server that provides AI-powered code analysis using local Ollama models. The server integrates with Claude Code workflows to validate and audit AI-generated code across multiple dimensions.

## Implementation Overview

### Core Architecture
- **TypeScript-based**: Modern ES2022 with strict type checking
- **MCP Integration**: Full compliance with Model Context Protocol specification

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Type System (`src/types.ts`)
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all audit operations
- Strong typing for requests, responses, configurations, and metadata
- Support for multiple audit types, severity levels, and context parameters

#### 2. Ollama Integration (`src/ollama/`)
- **Client**: HTTP wrapper with connection pooling, retries, and performance metrics
- **Models**: Configuration and specialization mapping for different AI models
- **Prompts**: Sophisticated, context-aware prompts for each audit type

#### 3. Auditor System (`src/auditors/`)

- **Security Auditor**: OWASP Top 10 focused, with pattern matching and severity adjustment
- **Completeness Auditor**: Static analysis for TODOs, empty functions, missing error handling
- **Performance Auditor**: Algorithmic complexity detection, optimization opportunities
- **Specialized Auditors**: Quality, Architecture, Testing, Documentation auditors

#### 4. Main Server (`src/server.ts`)
- MCP-compliant server with tool registration and request handling
- Support for parallel audits with configurable concurrency limits
- Health checking, configuration management, and error handling
- Request deduplication and caching capabilities

#### 5. Utilities (`src/utils/`)
- **Code Parser**: Language detection, function/class extraction, comment analysis
- **Complexity Analysis**: Cyclomatic, cognitive, Halstead metrics, maintainability index
- **Logger**: Structured logging with performance metrics and audit trails

#### 6. CLI Setup (`cli/setup.ts`)
- Automated setup script with prerequisite checking
- Model installation and health verification
- Configuration generation and testing
