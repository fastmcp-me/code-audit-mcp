# Pre-commit Hooks Setup Complete

## Overview

Successfully configured pre-commit hooks for the TypeScript project using husky and lint-staged.

## Installed Dependencies

- **husky**: ^9.1.7 - Git hooks made easy
- **lint-staged**: ^16.1.2 - Run linters on staged files

## Configuration Added

### package.json Scripts

Added the following script:

```json
"prepare": "husky"
```

### lint-staged Configuration

Added lint-staged configuration to package.json:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{ts,js}": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "prettier --write"
  ],
  "*.{json,md}": [
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```

### Husky Pre-commit Hook

Created `.husky/pre-commit` file with:

```bash
npx lint-staged
```

## What This Does

1. When developers commit changes, the pre-commit hook automatically runs
2. lint-staged processes only staged files matching the patterns
3. For TypeScript/JavaScript files: runs ESLint with auto-fix and Prettier formatting
4. For JSON/Markdown files: runs Prettier formatting
5. If any tool fails, the commit is blocked until issues are resolved

## Installation Commands Used

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky
npm install --save-dev lint-staged
npx husky init
```

- `/Users/warrengates/Documents/code/code-audit-mcp/.husky/pre-commit` - Updated to run lint-staged
