# CI/CD Quality Checks Implementation

## Overview

Updated the GitHub workflow and package.json scripts to include comprehensive linting, formatting, and type checking for CI/CD pipeline.

## Changes Made

### Package.json Scripts Added

- `type-check`: TypeScript type checking without emitting files (`tsc --noEmit`)
- `lint:fix`: ESLint with auto-fix capability
- `quality-check`: Comprehensive check script that runs lint, format:check, and type-check
- `quality-fix`: Auto-fix script that runs lint:fix and format
- Updated `prepublishOnly` to run quality-check before build

### GitHub Workflow Updates

1. **Validate Job**:
   - Added separate steps for formatting check, linting, and type checking
   - Runs before build to catch issues early
   - Fails fast on any quality check failure

2. **Build Job**:
   - Added quality check verification before building
   - Ensures no code quality issues make it to the build stage

3. **Test Matrix**:
   - Added `fail-fast: true` to stop on first failure across matrix builds

### Lint-Staged Updates

- Added type checking to the pre-commit hooks
- Ensures type safety is maintained in commits

## Benefits

- Prevents builds with formatting issues, linting errors, or type errors
- Fail-fast approach saves CI/CD time and resources
- Comprehensive quality gates ensure code consistency
- Auto-fix capabilities for development workflow
- Type safety enforcement throughout the pipeline

## Scripts Usage

```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run quality-check

# Auto-fix issues where possible
npm run quality-fix

# Individual checks
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run type-check
```

## CI/CD Flow

1. Code formatting check
2. Linting validation
3. Type checking
4. Tests execution
5. Build artifacts (only if all checks pass)
6. Platform testing
7. Publication

This ensures a robust quality gate at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline.
