# Issue: Module System Blocking Multi-File Projects (v4)

## Priority: CRITICAL ðŸ”´

## Summary

The Module System phase is currently at 25% completion and BROKEN, preventing multi-file project support in the Script language implementation.

## Impact

- Blocks development of complex applications requiring multiple files
- Prevents modular code organization
- Limits scalability of Script language projects
- Affects overall project completion (currently at 80%)

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Module System
- **Completion**: 25%
- **Status**: BLOCKED
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - requires investigation

## Required Actions for v4

1. **Investigation Team**: Assign 2 developers to analyze module system failure
2. **Fix Implementation**: Address core module loading/resolution issues
3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive multi-file project tests
4. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing phases
5. **Documentation**: Update module system usage documentation

## Dependencies

- Code Generation phase (85% complete) - may be related
- Runtime phase (60% complete) - likely interdependent
- Standard Library phase (30% complete) - may require module system

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Module system reaches 100% completion
- [ ] Multi-file projects can be successfully compiled and executed
- [ ] All existing functionality remains intact
- [ ] New test suite passes for module scenarios
- [ ] Overall project completion reaches 90%+

## Timeline

- **Target for v4**: Next sprint cycle
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 sprint cycles with dedicated team

## Team Assignment

Requires specialized team of 5 developers working in parallel:

1. Module System Investigation Lead
2. Module Resolution Developer
3. File System Integration Developer
4. Testing & QA Engineer
5. Documentation & Integration Specialist
